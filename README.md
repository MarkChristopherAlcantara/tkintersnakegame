Snake game in python
This code is a classic Snake Game implementation using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical interface. The game window is 600x400 pixels, and the snake moves in a grid where each cell is 20x20 pixels. The game's main features include:

Initialization: The game initializes with a single-segment snake starting in the middle of the screen, moving to the right. The score is set to zero, and the game is running.

Movement: The snake moves in the direction specified by the direction variable. The snake's head moves one cell at a time, and if it eats the food, it grows longer. If it collides with itself, the game is over.

Food Placement: Food appears at random locations on the grid that do not overlap with the snake's body. When the snake eats the food, the score increases, and new food is placed.

Drawing: The game continuously redraws the snake, food, and score on the canvas. The snake is drawn as green rectangles, food as red rectangles, and the score in white text.

Direction Change: The direction of the snake can be changed using the arrow keys. The game prevents the snake from moving in the opposite direction immediately (to avoid self-collision).

Game Over and Restart: When the game is over, "Game Over" text is displayed, and the option to restart appears. Clicking "Restart" resets the game to its initial state.

Blinking Text: The restart text blinks to draw attention. This blinking behavior is controlled by the blink_restart_text function.

The code uses the tk.Canvas widget to handle all the drawing operations, and root.after() method to create a game loop that updates the snake's movement and game state at regular intervals. The game logic is contained within several functions that handle movement, drawing, food placement, direction changes, and restarting the game.
